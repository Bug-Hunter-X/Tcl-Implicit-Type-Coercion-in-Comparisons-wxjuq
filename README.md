This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Tcl related to implicit type coercion during comparisons. The `bug.tcl` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from the use of the `==` operator, which may not always produce the expected results due to the automatic type conversions in Tcl. The solution employs the `eq` operator for string comparison, providing more reliable and predictable results in such cases.
